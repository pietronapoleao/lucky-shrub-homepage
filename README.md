## 🧠 Development Process

While completing this project, I focused on applying everything I learned in the course:

- I used Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts across devices.
- I explored hover and transform effects to make the site more dynamic.
- I created a visual identity that aligns with Lucky Shrub’s brand using shades of green and soft tones.
- I added a services section with external links and matching images, carefully selected to match the brand's aesthetic.

## ✅ Conclusion

This exercise helped me solidify my knowledge of HTML and CSS, especially around building accessible and responsive layouts. I enjoyed designing with both code and creativity in mind and look forward to building the next projects!
